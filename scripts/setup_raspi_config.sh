# raspi-config flags consolidated in one place:
#   I2C   (do_i2c 0)        — required by the LSM9DS1 IMU (bus 1)
#   SPI   (do_spi 0)        — required by the MAX7219 dot matrix
#   serial console off      — frees the Pi's UART pins for future modules and
#                              stops getty from grabbing /dev/serial0
#   serial hw on            — keeps the underlying hardware UART available
#
# Idempotent: raspi-config nonint do_* is a no-op if already in the requested
# state. Safe to re-run.
